# Profile

I'm Galang, a professional digital artist and designer based in Indonesia. I specialize in Graphics Design, PowerPoint Designer and 3D Design, creating visually captivating designs that make an impact.

Currently, I work as a Creative Strategies professional at RRGraph Design, where I develop innovative design solutions for clients and product experience. In my role, I take ideas and transform them into high-fidelity products, while also making valuable contributions to product roadmaps, design systems, branding, and more. Additionally, I mentor a 3D design voxel course at PixelNinja, guiding aspiring designers in mastering 3D design techniques.

I also contribute my digital design assets to various microstock markets, Through these contributions, I aim to provide high-quality design resources that help other designers enhance their projects.

**When I'm not designing you can find me:**
