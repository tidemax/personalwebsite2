I'm Galang! **Digital artist** & designer based in Indonesia, who really like 8bit design and games, Initially inspired by pixel games and isometric art in general, Ever since I discovered MagicaVoxel, I have been captivated by voxels. I am self-taught being enthusiastic about pixels and voxels.
I am currently a **Creative Strategies** working within amazing team at design agency **[RRGraph Design](https://www.rrgraphdesign.com)**. Day-to-day, I'm taking the product from idea to hi-fidelity and contributing on Prduct Roadmap, Design System, Branding, etc.
When I’m not creating you’ll find me watching the latest Netflix documentary series, taking pictures, making the best Spotify playlists or trying to not fall off a paddle board.
